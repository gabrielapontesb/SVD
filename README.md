### Linear Algebra

#### Question 1

Assume	that	the	singular	value	decomposition	of	A	can	be	described	as	A	=	UΣV.	Determine	the	matrix	Σ and	V for	the	matrix A.

#### Question 2

Use	any	none-quadratic	picture	of	dimension larger	than	400x400	and	apply	Singular	Value	Decomposition	to	find	an	approximation	to the	original	image. **Solution in the .ipynb file.**

- Investigate	the	dependency	of	the	reconstructed	image	on	the	number	(r)	of	singular	values	that	you	use	for	reconstruction.	Choose	at	least	5 values	of	r	for	that	investigation.	Also	produce	an	error	image	(difference	between	original	and	from	approximated	matrix	reconstructed	image).	Indicate	the	compression	ratio for	each	r.	

- Which r	would	you use	so	that	you	can	still	perform	face	recognition	on	the	reconstructed	image?

- Which	r	would	you	chose	if	you	had	to	recognize	dark	and	bright	spot in	the	image only?

- Which	r	would	you	chose	if	you	had	to	recognize	forms	(like	cars,	people,	etc.)

- Can	you	think	of	other	methods	to	do	image	compression	without	losing	too	muh	information?
